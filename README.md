# Ravelin JavaScript Code Test
Build a d3 graph of similar restaurants in London using the Foursquare API. Feel free to use any library or framework of choice. Please include a README alongside your code test detailing how to run it.

## User Story
A user visits a website with three text fields:

- Foursquare API Client ID
- Foursquare API Client Secret
- Venue Name

After entering the API Client ID/Secret and venue name, the user is given a list of venues to choose from (as their seed node).

Once the venue is picked, a D3 graph with the seed node (representing the venue) will appear. This node will then have similar venues extend from it (each connected via a single edge - see diagram).

As time passes, for each node, a venue API call (`v2/venues/{venueId}/similar`) will be made and the graph will grow with similar venues the API returns. The graph will continue to grow until the user presses the spacebar.

## Foursquare API Endpoints
- https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search?near=London&query={venueName}&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}&v=20200226
- https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/{venueId}/similar?client_id={CLIENT_ID}&client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}&v=20200226

## Obtaining Foursquare Credentials
To get access to the Foursquare API you need to create a developer account. Follow the steps in the [Foursquare docs](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api) to:
- Sign up
- Create an app (your app URL can be localhost)
- Obtain your Client ID and Client Secret

## Nice to haves
- Show us your CSS chops. Try and do some amount of original CSS styling.
